# What

To have an engaged presence within the community with the goal of helping that community to grow and flourish.

A rising tide lifts all boats.

1. A presence in code: open source software usage, contribution and support
2. A presence in webspace: writing online and engaging in the social web
3. A presence in meatspace: speaking and having a presence in the community IRL
4. * Support/Promote/Participate in events and initiatives at the company level through either Behance and/or Adobe.

# Why

While the altruistic aspects of these efforts generate good will and makes us feel good, there are all also real business benefits as well.

Recruitment: people will want to come work at your company
Retainment: your current developers will be happier being a part of the community
Learning: you become a better developer and os citizen, the more engaged you are
Better tools and software: your contributions and support, as well as from others, creates better tooling and software for everyone
Good will: the community will appreciate your efforts to give back to the community
Mega Meta points: people will just think you and your company are super cool

# How

**Open source software:**
Use open source software and give back to it. Fix bugs, add features, be involved.

# Write online:
what: articles, observations, roundups, release comments
where: our blog, other technical sites (cross post?), Twitter, Medium, Hakka etc.
Engage IRL:
what: speak, attend, engage
where: conferences, meetups, hackathons
Other alternative contributions:
-- Stack Overflow presence
-- Lecture/mentoring
-- Write/edit/contribute to printed materials

Why not? Why isn't this just happening already?
There are many reasons why this doesn't happen naturally. Here are some possible explanations:
-- A developer may just think they aren't good enough to contribute to open source or to speak at a meetup or conference
-- A developer may not see how speaking, writing or contributing affects their own work/career
-- A developer may just prioritize it lower than all of the other things required of them.
The good news is that these are all easily addressed.

How could? What things can we do to encourage and support developers to engage
The first and most important thing to do is to make this sort of developer engagement an integral part of what we do as a tech team. It needs to be clearly promoted and encouraged from the top-down, the bottom-up and sideways. We need to embrace this as a group.
Initiatives the Dev Rel group could take on:
-- spur more lunch and learn gatherings on technical (and non-technical - for practice and entry point) topics from our team
-- begin an open office hours time slot every week where one or more of the dev rel team will be available to help work through a presentation, article or other engagement
-- organize how-tos (online and in person) on how to become more engaged whether it be speaking, writing or contributing
-- lead by example

How are we doing?
We should do our best to measure our engagement and the return on that engagement. While the latter may be hard, the former could be both informative and fun. Here are some ideas:
-- we can establish goals and potentially gamify them: get points for your engagement with a leaderboard mentioned at each dev syncup
-- integrate analytics into all of our online efforts

What are others doing?
Let's take a quick look at some examples of other tech teams doing this well
Etsy (Code as Craft)
Etsy is a prime example. They crafted a brand (Code as Craft) and built it into a shining beacon of technology. They regularly give talks and write about their technology. I don't know a single developer who wouldn't be stoked to go work at Etsy.
Spotify
Spotify's interest is two fold: one being to attract and retain good talent and two being their goal to get developer to use their APIs and build on their platform. Regardless, they are active and engaged in the community and their presence is known. They regularly sponsor and promote hackathons and other tech events relating to music.
Others to be filled in more later?
-- Box.com?
-- Soundcloud?
-- Bocoup?
-- Pivotal
